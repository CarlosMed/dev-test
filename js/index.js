LCD monitors have several benefits over the old chunky computer monitors that most users are familiar with. Old computer monitors, take up quite a bit of desktop space, put out a ton of heat, drain a ton of energy, and most often have low picture quality and resolution. Modern advances with the LCD computer monitors have changed a lot of that. The screen itself is flat, and very thin, needing very little desktop space, therefore giving you more room while working at your PC. A big advantage in my opinion is that LCD monitors donâ€™t put off all the heat that the old monitors do.'
